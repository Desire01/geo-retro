# GeoRETRO memory-matching-game
A simple web based matching game to test the player's memory. Rating the user based on the number of moves they make.
Used as an Educative Aid for Kids to help sharpen their memory and also to help teach them about Earth and Space through images.
It Also Contains a Pc Version that pretty much has the same concept except in this one we added the Educative component after playing the game.
